          <p>Our holistic approach starts in the earliest preschool education where faith and academic endeavors are given equal weights in the development and formation of the person. In the classroom, ethical and moral considerations always complement intellectual discourse. We firmly believe in the essence of inculcating a strong spiritual foundation in every learner while sharpening his/her lifeâ€™s skills. We prepare you for life and expose you to unique challenges that enrich your mind, heart and spirit. We invite you to discover how we challenge you to learn and grow with us; join the hundreds of our proud graduates equipped to make their own distinction as Lourdesians.</p>

            <p>Founded in 1928 by the late Archbishop James Hayes, S. J. as San Agustin Parochial School, an elementary school for boys and girls. Five years later, in 1933, the school gave to the community its first twenty (20) graduates and responded to a growing felt need of High School Catholic Education in the city, the school operated with separate principals for the boys and for the girls. The girls division saw the birth of LOURDES ACADEMY which was managed by the Religious of the Virgin Mary (RVM) Sisters.</p>
